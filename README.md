1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial operates as a financial services firm, specializing in offering comprehensive financial planning and insurance solutions to its clientele. They approached me with the concern of ensuring the safe storage of sensitive data and establishing secure channels for both data uploads and downloads.
2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I believe I successfully executed the implementation of the keystore.jks. The instructions were somewhat unclear at times, but I managed to establish the keystore's functionality. Furthermore, I was able to assist a fellow classmate in integrating and configuring the keystore within the SSL for our final project. Emphasizing the importance of coding security is crucial, as the digital landscape is rife with threats and constant data breaches. Secure code practices serve as a strong defense against these dangers. In fact, safeguarding software contributes significantly to a company's overall well-being by fostering trust, enhancing reliability, and reducing the likelihood of the company making headlines for a major data breach—a scenario that has unfortunately become all too common in recent times.
3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The implementation of the hash algorithm posed some challenges for me. This was mainly due to the fact that the source code required the creation of a class that would throw an exception to make the message digest function properly. This particular aspect was not illustrated in the provided examples, making it a somewhat demanding task. Additionally, configuring the SSL proved to be a somewhat intricate process. Initially, I was unaware that the files were not in the correct location. However, through learning and adapting, I was able to place my own keystore precisely where it was needed for seamless processing in the final project. Despite the difficulties, I found these experiences to be valuable. I am committed to coding securely in my personal and professional life, and I believe it's essential to understand potential threats in order to protect both myself and the individuals for whom I develop code.
4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To improve security, I followed a systematic process. Initially, I conducted thorough dependency checks, ensuring that all components were up to date. Next, I scrutinized the source code meticulously to identify and rectify any potential errors. Subsequently, I integrated TLS and encryption measures. In a real-world scenario, I would employ a comparable approach. However, I'd strive to refine the accuracy of false positive lists in the dependency checks, as some of them proved overwhelming and challenging to navigate.
5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To assess functionality, I initially prioritized the elimination of any code errors within Eclipse. Once I had successfully debugged the code, I proceeded to run the service and accessed the localhost to verify the accuracy of the output. Additionally, I confirmed the secure access to the site via HTTPS using the self-signed certificate. Following any refactoring, I conducted an additional dependency check to identify potential new vulnerabilities, cross-referencing the results with the previous assessment. I also meticulously reviewed my code for any lingering errors.
6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Generating SSL certificates proved to be incredibly valuable. I intend to continue utilizing this approach in the future to assess secure communication during website development. Additionally, I found the dependency check tool to be a highly beneficial resource for analyzing potential risks. It is a tool I plan to incorporate into my workflow moving forward.
7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I aim to present the final document as a demonstration of my proficiency in identifying and addressing security threats. I believe that this skill is a foundation upon which I can further enhance my security awareness and become a more valuable asset to potential employers. Additionally, I intend to highlight my keystore.jks file and the code refactoring process, particularly in terms of implementing a self-signed certificate, as it serves as a valuable tool for testing purposes.
